Hi, I'm Oliwier

Physics student interested in mechanical engineering and experimental systems.

Currently learning CAD (Fusion), electronics, and Arduino while building small hands-on projects to develop real engineering skills.

I enjoy designing, building, and improving things — and I’m using this GitHub to document my progress as I grow.
